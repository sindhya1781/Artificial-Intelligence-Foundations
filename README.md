http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

Language used for implementation - Python 3.6

The repository contains solutions to the following Pac-man projects - 

1. Search Algorithms - 
Contains the implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

2. Multi Agent Search - 
Contains the implementation of multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms (with evaluation functions) on our agents pacman and the ghosts.
